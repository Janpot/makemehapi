Create a hapi server that listens on port 8080 and outputs
"Hello Hapi" when someone makes a GET request to /


When you have completed your server, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run server.js{/bold}

And once you are ready to verify it then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify server.js{/bold}

HINT

Create a server that listens on port 8080 with the following code:

var hapi = require('hapi');
var server = new hapi.Server(8080);


Add a route by calling the server route function and passing a route:

server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/',
    handler: function () {
        this.reply('My Reply');
    }
});


After you have added the appropriate route and handler, start
the server with the following code:

server.start();
